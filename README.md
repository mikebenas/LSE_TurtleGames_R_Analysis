Turtle Games, a company that both manufactures and sells games, aimed to analyze their products' segments, gauge customer sentiment, and predict sales in order to provide actionable insights to stakeholders. Their main objective was to enhance sales performance by leveraging customer trends. In this project, I conducted descriptive, diagnostic, prescriptive, and predictive analyses using both Python and R programming languages. I successfully cleaned and processed the data and created informative visualizations.

In Python, I utilized Linear Regression to build and evaluate models for predicting values for the Marketing department. Meanwhile, I performed the analysis for the Sales department in R, where I conducted statistical calculations, assessed data normality through techniques such as Q-Q plots, skewness, kurtosis, and the Shapiro-Wilk test. I also fitted multiple regression models to determine the most suitable one.

To cater to the marketing department's needs, I identified distinct customer groups that could be targeted for specific market segments. Using k-means clustering, I determined the optimal number of clusters and visualized the resulting segments. On the other hand, the sales department required an assessment of the reliability of data extracted from their website. I explored, prepared, and explained the normality of the dataset using various statistical techniques. Additionally, I examined the impact of products on sales through visualizations and employed Multiple Linear Regression in R to find an appropriate model.

Furthermore, I addressed the marketing department's interest in leveraging social data for informing marketing campaigns. By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP), I generated word clouds and analyzed sentiment scores.

Lastly, I identified valuable insights and presented recommendations, highlighting areas that could benefit from further analysis, while effectively addressing the business problems at hand.
